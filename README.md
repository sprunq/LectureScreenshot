# LectureScreenshot
A simple script for making automatic/manual screenshots of my Zoom lecture every time the slide changes or a button (F8) is pressed. 
This script saves every screenshot as a png in a session subfolder, which is randomly determined at startup, in the date subfolder. 
Compile the script screenshots into one pdf with applications like Gimp or online services.

## Setup:
Install Python and run these commands in the console: 
```
pip install Pillow
pip install keyboard
pip install pynput
```
